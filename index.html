          <p>
            So you've come! Thank you very much! That means you care enough
            about my work to come check more of it and it means a lot to me.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has
            supported me over the years with kudos and kind words through
            comments. I know I don't post quite often because of my depression,
            but I'm starting to get better, so I'll slowly produce more and more
            content, so look forward to it!
          </p>

            You may have been wondering why I'm making this very amateur website
            when I already have AO3. Well, AO3 is a non-profit organization and
            capitalizing on it is against the rules. That doesn't mean I'm gonna
            charge for my fics. No, those will be free forever. I just wanted my
            own place to post my original works and be able to place links for
            donations for those willing to help me out in these trying times.
            Because yes, I come up with originals as well, and I'm already
            developing my own BL to post here!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So sit back, grab a drink, and relax. It's time for some reading.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you want to check my fics, go ahead and use the AO3 link on the
            top of the page.
