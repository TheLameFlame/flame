        <p>When it first happened, Mizushima Hibiya didn't think much of it. He was in middle school then, practicing the piano while singing in the music room when the door suddenly rattled open.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>He stopped playing to look at who had interrupted him, and it turned out to be a girl he had seen a couple of times in the hallways before.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Oh, don't stop singing!” she said. “Do you mind if I stay for a while and listen?”</p>
        <br>
        <p>He blinked a few times at the request. “No, not at all.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>He sang and played several songs while the girl listened from a chair in the corner, a pleased smile on her lips. When the final song ended, he let out a long breath, and the girl applauded.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“That was incredible!” she said while approaching the piano.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Thank you!” Hibiya replied, a bit shy at the enthusiastic reaction. “It's nothing much, but I'm trying. One day, I hope I can be a great singer.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Well, I think you're already one.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“You're too kind.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“No, seriously! I had a terrible day and I had been pretty gloomy up until I heard you singing. In a matter of seconds, I felt all better, like everything I had gone through today wasn't all that important. I feel great now, so I'm the one who has to thank you!”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The compliment was big. It was the first time Hibiya had ever heard anything like it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>They walked out of the room together, talking lively. When she asked if she could watch his practice again, he agreed, and that was the start of his friendship with Haru.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The next few times had the same effect on the girl, who said she felt at peace when she listened to him. But on a particular week when Hibiya had fought with his mom and felt mad, she claimed that she was inexplicably feeling the same.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“It's weird,” she said. “Your singing feels angry to me, and it's making me feel angry as well. Ah, I don't mean to offend, it's just that…I wasn't feeling like this before I came in.  It's almost like your singing can change emotions, Hibiya-kun.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Nah!” He dismissed the comment with a gesture. “There’s no such thing! Maybe I'm just singing more aggressively since I'm mad at my mom.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Yeah, you're right. That would be absurd, wouldn't it?”</p>
        <br>
        <p>Despite what he said, Haru’s line kept bothering him, especially when it happened again, and suddenly people around him started sharing feelings with him.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>He tried singing at home to test things out, but now he was imagining other kinds of emotions instead. He emulated in his mind how he would feel when he was embarrassed, sad, or anxious, and was utterly surprised whenever his brother or parents seemed different than before his singing. He felt bad about using them like this, but he told himself it was necessary.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The ultimate proof came only several months later. He was walking out of the school gates when he saw three students dragging another one to an alleyway.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The bystanders whispered to each other about it, but no one took any action, so Hibiya discreetly followed them from a distance. Hiding behind the wall, he spied into the alley.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“You're such a piece of shit, Moriyama!” one of them growled, grabbing the boy by his shirt and shoving him against the wall. “Why did you snitch on us!?”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“I didn't!” Moriyama squeaks in terror. “It was probably Tomoya! He saw you cheating too!”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“We don't know for sure, do we? Both will have to pay for this.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>He raised his fist, and Moriyama protected his face with his arms to brace himself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At that moment, singing could be heard, stopping the aggressive boy in his tracks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hibiya quickly scanned his brain for a song until he found one that fit the situation perfectly: Thoughtless, by Korn. While he did it, he tried to project an apologetic feeling.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“What the hell!?” one of the bullies asked, looking at the corner behind which Hibiya was hiding.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“Go check who's there. They need some beating too.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The other, too, hesitated.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Um… I don't know. Maybe we should just stop.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Huh!?”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Come on, don't you feel bad for him?”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“Why would I-” he froze, looking at Moriyama like he had grown another head. “What is this? I just felt like beating the shit out of you, but what am I even doing?” He released Moriyama. “You're right, it's not worth it. My bad, man. Come on, let's go.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>That was Hibiya’s cue to sprint out of there. While he ran, he couldn't help smiling, feeling exulted.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Moriyama was left behind in the alleyway, trying to make sense of what had just happened.</p>
