        <p>As the years passed, Hibiya learned to deal with his ability, only using it when necessary. At first, he worried about the effects it would cause on others and tried not to use it as much as he could. But he unfortunately wasn't as patient as he wished, and sometimes people would make a point of going out of their way to piss him off. In such cases, it was hard to resist the temptation of punishing them accordingly—maybe with some unjustified wave of shame or fear. At times, he would feel guilty afterwards, at others, he wouldn't. It was a work in progress, but he liked to think he was only human after all, so it was normal to fail and fall into temptation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In the meantime, he grew even more attached to music, and his dreams grew bigger with each passing day. It came to a point where they had outgrown Japan. He came to realize that he didn’t belong in only one country, but the whole world. That motivated him to pursue studying abroad, and he received the letter of acceptance to be an exchange student in Cambridge with great joy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>It was a bittersweet experience for his parents, however. They would miss their son, but his future was way more important than that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The bigger issue was telling Tsubasa, his girlfriend at the time. She cried and yelled since Hibiya had decided they should break up. To him, it would be impossible to keep a long-distance relationship like that. She agreed with that bit, but she still didn’t want to be away from him.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“Never show up in front of me again!” she angrily said before stomping away.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Haru was nothing short of supportive, cheering for him and consoling him for the matter with Tsubasa.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“You’re meant to achieve big things in life, Hibiya-kun! I know it! I’ll be here for you whenever you need me, and hey! You can always hop on a plane during vacation!”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The next days were filled with packing and farewells, and sooner than he expected, he was on board a plane to an unknown country where he would work hard to get everything he wanted. He had the confidence to do it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Once he settled down, he found out that life in Oxford was pretty cozy. His dorm room was individual and neat, and the city was charming with its old architecture. The weather was quite cold for him, but he would adapt.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>While classes didn’t start, he loved taking strolls and visiting different shops to see which ones he would like the most. He was doing just that when he met him in a place that seemed like any other clothes shop, but upon closer inspection, it had some nice pieces at an affordable price, so he went inside to take a look.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>He was browsing the jeans selection when a voice suddenly sounded from the side asking if he needed help, startling him. The voice laughed, and when Hibiya looked, his jaw dropped.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>He was black, with dreadlocks that reached his shoulder blades. He was about Hibiya’s height and had chiseled arms that made him want to grab them right away.  The smile on his face was mischievous and looked like it was painted on.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you! Do you tend to get this engrossed while looking at clothes?”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Hibiya didn’t reply. He was too mesmerized by the light reflected on his dark skin.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“Is everything all right?” the man asked, and that shook Hibiya back to reality.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“Oh. Yes, sorry. I spaced out.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“Oh. You’re not from here,” he observed, not missing Hibiya’s accent.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“No, I’m from Japan, actually.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Ooh, that’s cool! Did you move here to study? Classes are just about to start at uni.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Yeah, that’s right,” Hibiya said with a smile. He could feel the blood rushing to his face the more he spoke to the handsome stranger.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“Well, in that case, welcome to Britain! I hope you have a great time over here.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Thank you very much!”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“So, can I help you pick something?”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Ah, yes, please.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>Together, they searched the aisles in search of something that would suit Hibiya. Every time he tried something new, he would show it to the vendor, and his gaze running up and down his body never failed to send a thrill down his spine. He soon found out that the vendor had a very honest insight into what looked good on him or not. It helped since Hibiya didn’t know anything about fashion and often couldn’t tell if his outfit looked good.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the end, he decided to buy a pair of jeans and a shirt.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name,” Hibiya said, standing with the shop bag in his hand.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. It’s Zane. Zane Edwards.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Nice to meet you,” he bowed. “I’m Hibiya Mizushima.” Saying his surname after his name still felt a bit weird to him.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Zane released a small laugh. “Yep, there’s no doubt about your origin with that bow!”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Ah, it’s the force of the habit!”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“It’s fine! I think it’s cute.”</p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Cute!? Could he be…?</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Zane noticed a woman walking in, so he bid Hibiya farewell. “I need to go to that customer. My coworker is on her day off, so I can’t chat for long.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“It’s fine. Thank you!”</p>
        <br>
        <p>Zane smiled and waved before walking away, leaving Hibiya staring at his broad back. He shook himself out of his daze and made his way back to the dorms.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As soon as he stepped on the lounge, a girl called him with her arm raised.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Come join us, newcomer!” she said. She was a local, with brown hair secured with a clasp. She was in the middle of the group sitting all around the room.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Ah, no, it's fine.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>She dismissed his line with a gesture. “Oh, don't be like that. Have a drink with us!”</p>
        <br>
        <p>Not having found a reason to deny her, he timidly approached the group and squeezed himself in.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As soon as he was settled, the girl shoved a can of beer into his hand.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Thanks, but I can't drink that.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Why not?” she asked with a raised brow.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“I'm not at the legal age.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Huh? How old are you!?” a male student with pink hair butted in. This one inhabited the room next door to Hibiya's. His name was Mark.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Eighteen.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Then it should be fine!” Mark exclaimed with a smile.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“In my country, we can only drink when we reach twenty.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“But you're here now, so what's the matter?” the girl said. “I'm Hazel, by the way. Hazel Stuart.” She offered her hand.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Hibiya Mizushima. Nice to meet you!” he introduced himself, shaking her hand.</p>
        <br>
        <p>He eyed the can of beer suspiciously, but he guessed they were right. He might as well give it a try. He cracked it open, then brought it to his lips, taking a tentative sip. The bitter taste flooded his mouth, making him grimace, much to the enjoyment of the students around him, who barked loud laughs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“This… I don't think I like this.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Let's say beer is kind of an acquired taste. You end up loving it without realizing it!” Mark said, taking a satisfied swig from his own drink.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From that evening onwards, Hibiya started hanging out with Mark and Hazel whenever he had the chance. They were pleasant to be around, cheerful, and easy to talk to. They made him feel comfortable and welcome, especially when classes started and he got overwhelmed with it all.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Once, Hibiya asked about Mark's hair and he proposed that they put some ink on his own. Hibiya ended up accepting, and he now sported a blue fringe that he styled by spiking it to his left.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As soon as it was done, Hibiya ran to Zane's store under the guise of buying another pair of jeans, but he actually just wanted to show off to the man. He was hoping to be called cute once again in that deep voice that gave him the chills.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Zane reacted by staring gobsmacked at him.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“What the fuck did you do?” he asked, sinking Hibiya’s heart in his chest.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Did you not like it? Sheesh, it was so troublesome to do it, too…”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“What, did you dye it for me?”</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hibiya went red. He hadn’t realized that his line could be interpreted like that. He stumbled on his words trying to justify himself, and that only made Zane laugh at his face.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Hey, stop laughing! I did it just because one friend of mine suggested, that’s all!”</p>
        <p>“Relax, relax,” Zane dismissed with his hand. “And don’t worry, it looks pretty cool. Actually, you look so hot like this I feel like taking you on a date. What do you say?”</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hibiya’s eyes went wide. Was this really happening? Was Zane just messing with him again? He did seem to enjoy doing that. If so, he would need to thank Mark for the hair dye. To think that was all he needed to do to get Zane’s attention… It filled Hibiya’s chest with excitement.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Unfortunately, that’s when Zane’s coworker, a woman with short hair and a bored expression, chose to come in and interrupt them while she carried a heavy looking box. She told him he would get in trouble for flirting with the customers again, which caused Hibiya to feel quite jealous. After all, there he was, thinking he was special, just to find out that he wasn’t and that was a regular occurrence.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, Zane reassured him. “Don’t listen to her. Before you, I had never flirted with anyone here.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hibiya threw the woman, whose name tag read Melissa, a glance, and her smirk told him that Zane was telling the truth. “Sheesh, way to throw me on an emotional roller coaster!”</p>
        <br>
        <p>This time, she was the one laughing. “Sorry, pretty boy! You seem easy to be messed with, so I wanted in on that!”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“She has a point,” Zane commented, earning a playful smack to the head.</p>
